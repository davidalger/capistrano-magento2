# Capistrano::Magento2

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-magento2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-magento2)

A Capistrano extension for Magento 2 deployments. Takes care of specific Magento 2 requirements and adds tasks specific to the Magento 2 application. Supports zero-down deployments based on differences in deployed `config.php` and db status as reported by Magento's `setup:db:status` CLI command. When themes and scopes have been dumped to `config.php` via `bin/magento app:config:dump scopes themes i18n` then zero-side-effect pipeline will be utilized such that no database nor cache backend configuration are available during the build process.

## Supported Magento Versions

The following describes minimum Magento versions supported by releases of this gem. Please use an earlier version to deploy older releases of Magento not supported by the most recent iterations of this gem.

* Version 0.9.x supports deployment of Magento 2.3.0 and later.
* Version 0.7.x supports deployment of Magento 2.1.1 and later.

## Installation

### Standalone Installation

    $ gem install capistrano-magento2

### Using Bundler

1. Add the following to your project's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'capistrano-magento2'
    ```

2. Execute the following:

        $ bundle install

## Usage

1. Install Capistrano in your Magento project:
    
    ```shell
    $ cd <project_root>
    $ mkdir -p tools/cap
    $ cd ./tools/cap
    $ cap install
    ```
_Note: By default, Capistrano creates "staging" and "production" stages. If you want to define custom staging areas, you can do so using the "STAGES" option (e.g. `cap install STAGES=stage,prod`). Built-in notifications ([see below](#terminal-notifier-on-os-x)) confirm deploy action on both "production" and "prod" area names by default._

2. Update your project's `Capfile` to look like the following:

    ```ruby
    # Load DSL and set up stages
    require 'capistrano/setup'
    
    # Load Magento deployment tasks
    require 'capistrano/magento2/deploy'
    require 'capistrano/magento2/pending'
    
    # Load Git plugin
    require "capistrano/scm/git"
    install_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Git
    
    # Load custom tasks from `lib/capistrano/tasks` if you have any defined
    Dir.glob('lib/capistrano/tasks/*.rake').each { |r| import r }
    ```

3. Configure Capistrano, per the [Capistrano Configuration](#capistrano-configuration) section below.

4. Configure your server(s), per the [Server Configuration](#server-configuration) section below.

5. Deploy Magento 2 to staging or production by running the following command in the `tools/cap` directory:
    
    ```shell
    $ cap staging deploy
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    $ cap production deploy
    ```
    
## Default Configuration

### Capistrano Configuration

Before you can use Capistrano to deploy, you must configure the `config/deploy.rb` and `config/deploy/*.rb` files. This section will cover the basic details for configuring these files. Refer to the [Capistrano documentation](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/preparing-your-application/#configure-your-server-addresses-in-the-generated-files) and [README](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/blob/master/README.md) for more details.

1. Configuring `config/deploy.rb`
    
    Update the `:application` and `:repo_url` values in `config/deploy.rb`:
    
    ```ruby
    # Something unique such as the website or company name
    set :application, 'example'
    # The repository that hosts the Magento 2 application (Magento should live in the root of the repo)
    set :repo_url, 'git@github.com:acme/example-com.git'
    ```

2. Configuring `config/deploy/*.rb` files
    
    Capistrano allows you to use server-based or role-based syntax. You can read through the comments in the file to learn more about each option. If you have a single application server then the server-based syntax is the simplest configuration option.
    
    * Single application server
        
        If your stage and production environments consist of a single application server, your configuration files should look something like this:
        
        `config/deploy/production.rb`
        ```ruby
        server 'www.example.com', user: 'www-data', roles: %w{app db web}
        
        set :deploy_to, '/var/www/html'
        set :branch, proc { `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref master`.chomp }
        ```
        
        `config/deploy/staging.rb`
        ```ruby
        server 'stage.example.com', user: 'www-data', roles: %w{app db web}
        
        set :deploy_to, '/var/www/html'
        set :branch, proc { `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref develop`.chomp }
        ```
        
    * Multiple application servers
        
        Refer to the "role-based syntax" comments in the `config/deploy/*.rb` files or to the [Capistrano documentation](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/preparing-your-application/#configure-your-server-addresses-in-the-generated-files) for details on how to configure multiple application servers.

| `:composer_authoritative_classmap`     | `false`                  | Enables composer dumping of authoritative classmap

#### Example Usage

Add a line similar to the following in `config/deploy.rb` to set a custom value on one of the above settings:

```ruby
set :magento_deploy_jobs, '$(nproc)'
set :magento_deploy_themes, ['Magento/backend', 'Magento/blank']
set :magento_deploy_languages, ['en_US', 'en_CA']
```

### Capistrano Built-Ins

For the sake of simplicity in new project setups `:linked_dirs` and `:linked_files` are pre-configured per the following.

```ruby
set :linked_files, [
  'app/etc/env.php',
  'var/.setup_cronjob_status',
  'var/.update_cronjob_status'
]

set :linked_dirs, [
  'pub/media',
  'pub/sitemaps',
  'var/backups', 
  'var/composer_home', 
  'var/importexport', 
  'var/import_history', 
  'var/log',
  'var/session', 
  'var/tmp'
]
```

If you would like to customize the linked files or directories for your project, you can copy either one or both of the above arrays into the `config/deploy.rb` or `config/deploy/*.rb` files and tweak them to fit your project's needs. Alternatively, you can add a single linked dir (or file) using `append` like this:

```ruby
append :linked_dirs, 'path/to/link'
```

### Composer Auth Credentials

Magento 2's composer repository requires auth credentials to install. These can be set on target servers in a global composer `auth.json` file, the project's `composer.json` or by setting them in your deployment configuration using the following two settings:

```ruby
set :magento_auth_public_key, '<your_public_key_here>'
set :magento_auth_private_key, '<your_prviate_key_here>'
```

To obtain these credentials, reference the official documentation on DevDocs: [Get your authentication keys](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)

**Caution:** When using these settings, the values will be logged to the `log/capistrano.log` file by SSHKit. They will not, however, be included in the general command output by default.

### Magento 2 Deploy Routine

A pre-built deploy routine is available out-of-the-box. This can be overriden on a per-project basis by including only the Magento 2 specific tasks and defining your own `deploy.rake` file under `lib/capistrano/tasks` in your projects Capistrano install location.

To see what process the built-in routine runs, take a look at the included rake file here: https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/blob/master/lib/capistrano/tasks/deploy.rake

## Server Configuration

### Web Server Root Path

Before deploying with Capistrano, you must update each of your web servers to point to the `current` directory inside of the configured `:deploy_to` directory. For example: `/var/www/html/current/pub` Refer to the [Capistrano Structure](http://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/structure/) to learn more about Capistrano's folder structure.

### PHP Opcache Reset

When doing atomic deployments with php-opcache installed on a server, the cache will reach a full state after which application performance will degrade as a result of the opcache not being able to do it's job. To work nicely with this, there is support included for automatically resetting the php-opcache after a release is published.

To use this, include `require 'capistrano/magento2/cachetool'` in your `Capfile` and make sure there is an `/etc/cachetool.yml` or `/var/www/html/.cachetool.yml` (assuming `:deploy_to` points at `/var/www/html`) file configured with contents like the following:

    adapter: fastcgi
    fastcgi: /var/run/php-fpm/www-data.sock
    temp_dir: /dev/shm/cachetool
    extensions: [ opcache ]

With this configuration in place, be sure cachetool ([available from here](http://gordalina.github.io/cachetool/)) has already been installed on the server and is available in `$PATH`.

Congratulations! You should now begin to see the pre-deployemnt opcache status information when running a deployment followed immediately be the `cachetool opcache:reset` command used to keep things humming nicely along.

## Magento Specific Tasks

All Magento 2 tasks used by the built-in `deploy.rake` file as well as some additional commands are implemented and exposed to the end-user for use directly via the cap tool. You can also see this list by running `cap -T` from your shell.

## Pending Changes Support

When the line `require 'capistrano/magento2/pending'` is included in your `Capfile` per the recommended configuration above, this gem will report changes pending deployment in an abbreviated git log style format. Here is an example:

```
00:00 deploy:pending:log
      01 git fetch origin
    ✔ 01 dalger@localhost 1.241s
    ✔ 01 dalger@localhost 1.259s
      Changes pending deployment on web1 (tags/2.1.2 -> 2.1):
      f511288 Thu Feb 23 12:19:20 2017 -0600 David Alger (HEAD -> 2.1, tag: 2.1.4, origin/2.1) Magento 2.1.4
      7fb219c Thu Feb 23 12:17:11 2017 -0600 David Alger (tag: 2.1.3) Magento 2.1.3
      570c9b3 Thu Feb 23 12:12:43 2017 -0600 David Alger Updated capistrano configuration
      No changes to deploy on web2 (from and to are the same: 2.1 -> 2.1)
```

When there are no changes due for deployment to any host, a warning requiring confirmation will be emitted by default:

```
No changes to deploy on web1 (from and to are the same: 2.1 -> 2.1)
No changes to deploy on web2 (from and to are the same: 2.1 -> 2.1)
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/n]
```

This confirmational warning can be disabled by including the following in your project's configuration:

```ruby
set :magento_deploy_pending_warn, false
```

### Pending Changes Configuration

| setting                          | what it does
| -------------------------------- | ----------
| `:magento_deploy_pending_role`   | Role to check for pending changes on; defaults to `:all`
| `:magento_deploy_pending_warn`   | Set this to `false` to disable confirmational warning on zero-change deployments
| `:magento_deploy_pending_format` | Can be used to set a custom change log format; refer to `defaults.rb` for example

### Pending Changes Tasks

| cap command                           | what it does                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| deploy:pending                        | Displays a summary of commits pending deployment   |

Note: For more details including screenshots of what this functionality does, reference [this post](https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/issues/58#issuecomment-282404477).

## Terminal Notifier on OS X

This gem includes an optional configuration file include which adds notification support via the [terminal-notifier](https://rubygems.org/gems/terminal-notifier) gem. To configure notifications, simply add the following line to your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/magento2/notifier'
```

**Notice:** The `terminal-notifier` gem is currently macOS specific and thus can not be used on generic *nix environments. Because this gem has been known to cause ruby stability issues on certain non-macOS environments, it is not specified as a hard requirement in this gem's gemspec. When using this functionality, it is expected the gem either be already present on your working environment or be added to your project's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'terminal-notifier'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Make the necessary changes, then run `bundle exec rake install` to install a modified version of the gem on your local system.

To release a new version, update the version number in `capistrano/magento2/version.rb`, merge all changes to master, and then run `bundle exec rake release`. This will create a git tag for the version (the tag will apply to the current HEAD), push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

_Note: Releasing a new version of the gem is only possible for those with maintainer access to the gem on rubygems.org._
